                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Nicole, and I’ve been practicing Reflexology since 2016. With a background in Health
                        Sciences, I began my Reflexology journey by completing a
                        150-hour certification program with Tracy McGovern at Essential Connections. Soon after, I earned
                        nationally certified through the American Reflexology Certification Board (ARCB).</p>
                </div>
                <p>I’m committed to ongoing learning and have explored a variety of addtional techniques, including Hand, Ear, and Facial Reflexology. 
                    I also completed a 25-hour
                    course through CARE, where I trained in Raindrop Therapy, Vita Flex, the
                    chemistry of essential oils, and emotional release methods.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I’ve seen how transformative Reflexology can be in reducing
                    stress, easing pain, supporting mental health, and bringing balance to the nervous system. It's a priviledge to share this gentle,
                holistic practice and help clients discover greater wellness in their daily lives.</p>
