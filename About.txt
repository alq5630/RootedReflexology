About Nicole

Hi, I’m Nicole, and I’ve been practicing Reflexology since 2016. With a background in Health Sciences and a deep passion for holistic healing, I began my Reflexology journey by completing a 150-hour certification program with Tracy McGovern at Essential Connections. Afterward, I became nationally certified through the American Reflexology Certification Board (ARCB).

I’m always eager to expand my knowledge, so I’ve continued my education by exploring additional Reflexology techniques, including Hand, Ear, and Facial Reflexology. I also completed a 25-hour course through CARE, where I learned specialized techniques like Raindrop Therapy, Vita Flex, the chemistry of essential oils, and emotional release methods.

I’m truly passionate about sharing the many benefits of Reflexology and how it can enhance overall well-being. Over the years, I’ve witnessed firsthand how powerful Reflexology can be in reducing stress, alleviating pain, supporting mental health, and promoting nervous system regulation. The stories and testimonials from my clients continually inspire me, especially when they share how Reflexology has helped them shift out of the stress response, allowing their bodies to naturally restore balance.

I believe that Reflexology, combined with the healing properties of essential oils, offers a profound opportunity to support and revitalize the body. It’s my mission to help people experience more vitality, peace, and balance in their lives.
